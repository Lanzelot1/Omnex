## Decision Making

### Lazy Consensus
Most decisions are made through lazy consensus:
- Proposals are made via GitHub issues or discussions
- If no objections within 72 hours, proposal is accepted
- Silence is considered approval

### Request for Comments (RFC)
Major changes require an RFC:
1. Create an issue with "RFC:" prefix
2. Include detailed proposal with rationale
3. Allow 1 week for community feedback
4. Core team makes final decision

### Voting
When consensus cannot be reached:
- Core team members each have one vote
- Simple majority wins
- Tie-breaker: project founder or designated lead
